            <h3>Why work remote?</h3>
            <p>Digital nomads</p>
            <p>
              Companies around the world are choosing to go partly or entirely remote as they are discovering the benefits of having a distributed team. It can help reduce costs by not needing to pay for large office space. This is especially beneficial for startups looking to bootstrap their operations. When there is no central office the talent pool a company can select from is no longer limited to their city and the surrounding area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why companies are choosing to not have central offices. Less overhead. Wider talent pool. Better for the environment (less people commuting)
            </p>
            <p>
              Why itâ€™s good for employee? Work life balance. Flexibility. World is your office.
